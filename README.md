# Microelectronics Workshop: K-12 Teacher Training

This repository is designed to support the [Microelectronics Workshop](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe/news/bridging-education-gap-microelectronics), aimed at providing K-12 high school teachers with hands-on experience in microelectronics and robotics education.

## Workshop Focus

The activities in this repository are centered around the [ELEGOO Smart Robot Car Kit V4.0](https://us.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-smart-robot-car-kit-v-4-0?srsltid=AfmBOorwgm91TkKKTckVMs_GMF5E3pMokobEb0JsvhOJ1aJz3mBzr9Nz). The kit provides an accessible platform for exploring robotics, sensors, programming, and engineering concepts.

## Contents

- **Original Code & Demos**: Selected from the ELEGOO-provided resources for the robot kit.
- **Custom Activities**: Specially designed exercises and code to facilitate educational activities focused on teaching and learning with the robot.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions & Comments**: All code is annotated with detailed comments to make it easy for teachers to follow and adapt for their classrooms.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended as an educational resource for teachers participating in the workshop to:
- Learn about microelectronics and robotics using an affordable, hands-on kit.
- Gain the skills needed to introduce these topics to K-12 students.
- Access ready-to-use code and activities with clear documentation.
